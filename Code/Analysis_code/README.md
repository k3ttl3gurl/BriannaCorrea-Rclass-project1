# Exploratory Analysis Code: Correa Edition

This folder contains code to do some simple analysis on the processed/cleaned Palmer Penguin Data.

For project 2 here are the following questions we will be covering with regards to our analysis: 

1. How does flipper length vary by species?

2. Does sex predict body mass when controlling for species?

3. Do foraging patterns differ by species or sex? 

## Order of Execution:

Run Script 1 (Summary Statistics) to calculate descriptive stats and create visual summaries.

Run Script 2 (Model Analysis) to conduct statistical modeling and fit relevant models.

Run Script 3 (Exploratory Visualization) last to generate visualizations based on the clean and analyzed data.


`statistical_analysis.R` is an R script that does some simple statistical model fitting and plotting.
`exploratory_analysis.qmd` is a Quarto file that adds commentary to this analysis. The quarto file pulls in code from the R script, so that only one code file needs to be maintained.

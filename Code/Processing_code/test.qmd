## Processing script (data cleaning)

### Setup

Load needed packages. Make sure they are installed.

```{r}
require(dplyr)   # for data processing/cleaning
require(tidyr)   # for data processing/cleaning
require(skimr)   # for nice visualization of data 
```

### Data loading

Start R in the same directory that this script resides in: `project_root/Code/Processing_code`.
If needed, check your working directory with `getwd()`.

**Never** put a `setwd()` inside your code â€” it's bad etiquette and will likely break for others.

```{r}
# Path to data using relative paths
data_location <- "../../Data/Raw_data/penguin_raw_dirty.csv"
data_path <- "../../Data/Raw_data/"
```
### Load data

Use `check.names=FALSE` to preserve original column names (which include spaces/parentheses).

```{r}
rawdata <- read.csv(data_location, check.names=FALSE)
```

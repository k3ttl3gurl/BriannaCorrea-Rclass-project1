# Summary/Abstract

_We cleaned data from the Palmer Penguins dataset, a collection of biological measurements from three penguin species (Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo) living in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. This dataset was collected as part of long-term ecological research aimed at monitoring penguin populations and understanding their behavior, physiology, and habitat use in a changing environment._

_Our analysis focuses on questions related to sex and speciation, as these are key factors that can influence physical traits, ecological roles, and survival strategies in wildlife populations. By exploring differences in flipper length, body size, and foraging signatures across species and sexes, we aim to better understand how these factors shape penguin biology and behavior._

# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Understanding biological differences between animal species and sexes is a central focus in ecological research. Physical traits such as body mass, flipper length, and foraging behavior can provide valuable insights into how animals adapt to their environments, compete for resources, and survive in changing conditions. In this project, we use penguins as a model to explore how sex and species influence key morphological and behavioral traits. Penguins, especially those in the Antarctic region, offer an interesting case study due to their environmental sensitivity and their role as indicators of ecosystem health._ 

## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._

_Here we describe an analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset [@Horst:2020], which contains data on three species of penguins from the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network [@Gorman:2014].

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
__The first question will rely heavily on statistical summary and the utilization of ggplot2. The second question will be a modeling question, this will be done with broom and ggplot2. broom is a way to take some untidy outputs given by lm() command and tidying them into a tibble as directed by CRAN. broom works with dplyr which we utilized in project 1. Finally, I will focus on a question that utilizes a visulization of the provided isotopes. For the clarity I offer the questions below:_

Our research questions are:

1. How does flipper length vary by species?

2. Does sex predict body mass when controlling for species?

3. Do foraging patterns differ by species or sex?

# Methods 

_Data Acquisition
For Project 1, data were cleaned by removing any typos, correcting inconsistencies, and addressing missing values. Outliers were identified and handled appropriately, ensuring that the dataset was ready for subsequent analysis. Since the data is from the Palmer Penguins dataset, the cleaning steps involved identifying erroneous entries (such as negative body mass or implausible flipper lengths) and replacing missing values with NA. These actions were performed using standard data wrangling techniques with the dplyr package.

In Project 2, the focus shifts from cleaning to exploring and modeling the data to answer specific research questions. We will employ a combination of descriptive statistics, linear modeling, and exploratory visualization to address these questions. More details can be found in Code and Data. Code will show exactly how data cleaning was done while Data will show the original raw uncleaned data for the Palmer Penguins and the new cleaned data sheet for the Palmer Penguins. These are filed as .csv._


## Data acquisition
_Data was retrieved through the following gitbash repo: https://github.com/mbutler808/Project-template. Data originally came from Palmer Data set which is accessible through CRAN._


## Data import and cleaning
_For Project 2, the cleaned dataset will be used to perform the necessary statistical analyses to answer the research questions. The R code for data import and cleaning can be found in the supplementary files._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Add in the text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summary_table shows a summary of the data.

_Note the data is loaded using a **relative** path indicated by the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\user\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path._ 

```{r , results="asis"}
#| label: tbl-summary_table
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")  # supresses printing of NAs
resulttable=readRDS("../../Results/summary_table.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, digits=2)
```

## Size

_As an example, here is an analysis of size by species and island.  You may leave this if you wish, but do edit it to make it your own._

We found that Gentoo penguins are substantially larger than both Adelie and Chinstrap penguins, which are similar in size
(@fig-mass_species_bars, ANOVA P-value < 0.001 ).

```{r}
#| label: fig-mass_species_bars
#| fig-cap: "Body mass distributions of the three species of penguin."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Results/mass_species_bars.png")
```

```{r , results="asis"}
#| label: tbl-mass_species_anova
#| tbl-cap: "Size differences between species."
#| echo: FALSE
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
resulttable=readRDS("../../Results/mass_species_anova.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, digits=2)
```

There does not seem to be any intrinsic island effect. Differences in mass across islands are related to the species which happen to reside on each island (@fig-mass_species_island_density, @tbl-mass_species_island_anova).

```{r}
#| label: fig-mass_species_island_density
#| fig-cap: "Body mass distributions of the three species of penguin."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Results/mass_species_island_density.png")
```

```{r , results="asis"}
#| label: tbl-mass_species_island_anova
#| tbl-cap: "Size differences between species by island."
#| echo: FALSE
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
resulttable=readRDS("../../Results/mass_species_island_anova.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, digits=2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Here is where I will summarize from start to finish what work was completed and what that meant and what was found._

## Strengths and Limitations
_It's important to discuss what are the strengths and limitations of your analysis. What more would you like to do in the future?_

## Conclusions
_Will complete alongside Project 3_

_Cittations will be found in Rmd file utilizing bibtex_

This paper [@Leek:2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@McKay:2020; @McKay:2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.

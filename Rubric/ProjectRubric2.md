# Project Rubric

Your audience is the user, members of the R-literate general public who may want to use your data and/or code. To be useful, the code and documentation must be clear enough to guide naive users in fully reproducing the analysis. Naive users may not know anything about the project, or may even be yourself after enough time has passed or projects multiplied! 

Elements:
1. Your github repo, organized following the project template.
2. Your modified code, quarto, and README files, organized in the repo.
2. Your output files (any requested output, i.e., `.csv`, `.html`, `.docx`, `.pdf` files) in their proper places in the repo.

|Criteria| Evaluation| Scoring | Points | Comments |
|:---------|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|__Right__| Code runs without Error - Must be YES | 0/10 |  10 | You did it!!!! So proud of you! |
|	  | Code produces correct output | 0-5 | 5 | Beautiful! |
|__Readable__| Code is readable (good use of white space, etc.) |0-5| 5  | Beautiful!! |
|        | Code is understandable (good naming conventions, concise informative comments) |||  |
|__Reproducible__| READMEs document project organization | 0-5| 5 |  |
|        | READMEs explain the order to run the code/quarto in order to reproduce analysis| || |
|        | READMEs list contents of each directory | ||  |
|__Aesthetics__| Files are free of unnecessary clutter (assignment instructions, etc.) | 0-5 | 5 | |
|        | Code is elegant (not required, but a bonus) |  | | |
|__Bottom Line__| | 30 | 30 | |



Project 2:

q1_flip_length.R - ALL scripts run without error! YAY!!!
q2_sex_mass.R
q3_flip_mass.R
"Script has run successfully! :)"  YAY!!!!!

exploratory_analysis.qmd  Runs without error!!!

Excellent job!!!!! 

Great research questions and very nice plan of attack!  The only thing I would add is to repeat the questions as subheaders before each section of plots and statistical results, and add a clearer statement. They do differ in flipper length, etc. 

Beautiful code and qmd report!

# Overview

This project is part of an R coding class focused on learning how to clean, analyze, and visualize externally provided data. It follows a structured approach using R, Quarto, and GitHub to promote reproducibility and good data science practices.

# Project

The Palmer Penguin Project is a dataset used for ecological and statistical analysis, featuring three species of penguins: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentooâ€”collected from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. The dataset includes measurements such as flipper length, bill depth, and body mass, along with categorical data like sex and species. It is often used as a cleaner, more intuitive alternative to the classic Iris dataset for machine learning and data visualization tasks. The project aims to support ecological research while serving as a valuable educational resource for data science and statistical modeling.

# Acknowledgement

This is Brianna Correa's class project repository, based on a template cloned and modified from <https://github.com/andreashandel/dataanalysis-template>

# Software requirements

This template lays out a data analysis project and report writing using R, Quarto, Github and a reference manager for bibtex. A plain text editor is also necessary, and wordprocessing software to open .docx if you wish to use that format (e.g. MS Word, MacOS Pages, or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)).

# Getting started

This is a Github template repository. The best way to get it and start using it is [by following these steps.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

Once you got the repository, you can check out the examples by executing them in order. 

1.  For this section of the project we will be working in Code and Data mostly. The other files are not necessary at this time.

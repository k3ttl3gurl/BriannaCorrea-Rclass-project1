This data is used for both scientific research on penguin populations and as a teaching tool for data analysis techniques.\n\n\n-  Saving data as RDS:\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files.  This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc.  If you save as CSV, that information would get lost.\nHowever, CSV is better for sharing with others since it's plain text.\n\n",

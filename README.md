# Overview

This project is part of an R coding class focused on learning how to clean, analyze, and visualize externally provided data. It follows a structured approach using R, Quarto, and GitHub to promote reproducibility and good data science practices.

# Project

The Palmer Penguin Project is a dataset used for ecological and statistical analysis, featuring three species of penguins: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentooâ€”collected from the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. The dataset includes measurements such as flipper length, bill depth, and body mass, along with categorical data like sex and species. It is often used as a cleaner, more intuitive alternative to the classic Iris dataset for machine learning and data visualization tasks. The project aims to support ecological research while serving as a valuable educational resource for data science and statistical modeling.

# History

2023-02-16 First release with Data and Code folders with materials for data cleaning and initial exploration.
2025-03-01 Cloned from M. Butler repo for R Class Spring 2025
2025-03-20 Original Submission by Brianna Correa with Data Cleaning Edits
2025-04-01 Currently under renovation for data cleaning

Content that has been updated includes the following for Project 1 Phase:

Code now runs without issues producing figures that are required for the project. 

Data is now processed and cleaned, bivariate plots are accounted for as well as the required histograms to demonstrate the new cleaned data.

Corrections made to the GitHub are now congruent with local files, README file has been updated to reflect project. 

Outliers are properly dealt with and documented.


Packages are not recommended to be downloaded and not done so forcibly. 


# Acknowledgement

This is Brianna Correa's class project repository, based on a template cloned and modified from <https://github.com/andreashandel/dataanalysis-template>

# Software requirements

This template lays out a data analysis project and report writing using R, Quarto, Github and a reference manager for bibtex. A plain text editor is also necessary, and wordprocessing software to open .docx if you wish to use that format (e.g. MS Word, MacOS Pages, or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)). 

For more R packages supporting reproducible research check out the taskview <https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html>

# Template structure

*Data can be found in the Data folder and any subfolders
*All code created will be found in the Code folder and any relevant subfolders
*Further modifications can be expected in the future. 

# Template content

* You will want to look at the README.md file in Code and Data at this time. 
*These areas will be able to give you more information regarding the Palmer Penguins morphology and life history data we are utilizing. 
*The Processing_code folder has the original raw data as well as the cleaned data. 
*More will come with updates related to Project 2

# Getting started

*As stated above this project is in processing. Therefore as of 4/1/2025 please look only in Code and Data for any relevant changes.
